Here we will do classical linear regression in a Bayesian setting. We will also show the difference between **credible intervals** and  **prediction intervals**.

In **Part 1** the data and the model are introduced. Participants then try to implement the model in BUGS. In **Part 2** the solution is exposed, and the difference between credible and prediction intervals is explained.

# The data

We will use data from **Michael Crawley's R Book**, Chapter 10 (Linear Regression). The data show the growth of catepillars fed on experimental diets differing in their tannin contnent.

To load the data to R directly from the web:

```{r}
  catepil <- read.table("http://www.petrkeil.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/regression.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
  catepil
```

The data look like this:

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
  plot(growth~tannin, data=catepil)
```

# The model

The classical notation:
$$ growth_i = a + b \times tannin_i + \epsilon_i  $$
$$ \epsilon_i \sim Normal(0, \sigma)$$


An alternative version:
$$ \mu_i = a + b \times tannin_i $$
$$ growth_i \sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma) $$

**Note:** The notations are mathematically equivalent, 
but the Bayesian notation shows, in my opinion, more directly 
how we think about the stochastic part of the model.

# Fitting ordinary least squares (OLS) regression

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
  model.lm <- lm(growth~tannin, data=catepil)
  plot(growth~tannin, data=catepil)
  abline(model.lm)
  summary(model.lm)
```

# Tasks for you

Using the ideas from previous lessons:

- Try to write the model in the BUGS language and dump it into a file using `cat`.

- Try to prepare the data for this model in the `list` format.

- Try to fit the model and estimate posterior distributions of $a$ and $b$.
