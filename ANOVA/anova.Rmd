```{r, echo=FALSE}
  ngroups <- 5
  nsample <- 10
  pop.means <- c(50, 40, 45, 55, 60)
  sigma <- 3
  
  n <- ngroups*nsample
  eps <- rnorm(n, 0, sigma)
  
  x <- rep(1:5, rep(nsample, ngroups))
  means <- rep(pop.means, rep(nsample, ngroups))
  X <- as.matrix(model.matrix(~as.factor(x)-1))
  snout <- round( as.numeric(X %*% as.matrix(pop.means) + eps), 2)
  snakes <- data.frame(population=x, snout.vent=snout)
  write.csv(snakes, file="snakes.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

The aim of this lesson is to (1) leave the participants to come up with their
code for simple one-way ANOVA, and (2) to experiment with random effects ANOVA.

# The Data

We will use modified data from the example from **Marc Kery's Introduction to WinBUGS for Ecologists**, page 119 (Chapter 9 - ANOVA). The data describe snout-vent lengths in 5 populations of Smooth snake (*Coronella austriaca*) (Uzovka hladka in CZ).

Loading the data from the web:
```{r, tidy=FALSE}
  snakes <- read.csv("http://www.petrkeil.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/snakes.csv")

# we will artificially delete 9 data points in the first population
  snakes <- snakes[-(1:9),]
  
  summary(snakes)
```

Plotting the data:
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
  par(mfrow=c(1,2))
  plot(snout.vent ~ population, data=snakes,
       ylab="Snout-vent length [cm]")
  boxplot(snout.vent ~ population, data=snakes,
          ylab="Snout-vent length [cm]",
          xlab="population",
          col="grey")
```

# Fixed-effects ANOVA

For a given snake $i$ in population $j$ **the model** can be written as:

$y_{ij} \sim Normal(\alpha_j, \sigma)$

## Tasks for you:

* Try to write this model in the BUGS language and dump it into a file
using `cat`.

* Try to prepare the data for this model in the `list` format.

* Try to fit the model and estimate posterior distributions of $\alpha_j$.

* Is there a significant difference of mean snout-vent length between 
populations 1 and 2?
